We are thrilled to announce that we are now accepting applications for [opportunity grants]({{ site.opportunity_grant_application }}). The deadline for submission is 31st March 2023 [AoE](https://time.is/compare/0000_01_April_2023_in_Anywhere_on_Earth).

Please have a look at our [opportunity grants](/opportunity-grants) page for further details of available grants.

The primary purpose of an opportunity grant is to facilitate the participation of those who otherwise might not be able to attend the conference. By providing grants that can be used for conference-related expenses like travel, accommodation, etc., we hope to help make the conference more accessible to a wider audience.

Everybody who would benefit from a grant is welcome to apply! It doesn’t matter if you are a first-time attendee or not, if you are an expert on Django or a newbie. However, we have limited funds, and we are trying to promote a more diverse community by prioritising first-time speakers and those in underrepresented or marginalised groups.

Our team is committed to maximising the impact of the opportunity grant program, and the selection process will take into consideration an applicant’s background, involvement in the community and positive influence attending can have in their development.

If you have questions, please reach out to us at [{{ site.contact_us_email }}](mailto:{{ site.contact_us_email }}).
