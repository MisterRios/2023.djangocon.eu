## Proposing to DjangoCon US

### Selection process

Weâ€™ll choose a selection of talks and tutorials that we feel add to the most enjoyable and engaging program for our attendees.
Volunteers from the Django community are invited to help us pick talks,
and we rely heavily on them to help us select interesting and beneficial ones for our attendees.
Community volunteers and conference organizers will review anonymized submissions and collectively decide which ones to accept.

## Topics

* Django internals and challenges in modern web development.
* Wild ideas, clever hacks, surprising or cool use cases.
* Improving Django and Python developersâ€™ lives.
* Pushing Django to its limits
* Fundamentals, in a modern light.
* The Django and Python community, culture, history, past, present & future, the why the who and the what of it all
* Security
* Whatever you deem appropriate â€“ it's your conference, after all!
