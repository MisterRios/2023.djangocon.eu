# What ticket should I buy?

If you are paying for your own ticket, you should buy an **Individual** ticket. If your company 
is paying, you should buy a **Corporate** ticket. For those who can't afford the Individual ticket,
a **discounted** ticket is available; see below. 

You can also buy a **supporter** ticket if you want to go above and beyond and support our mission!
These tickets will allow us to offer discounted and free tickets to people who couldn't otherwise
afford to attend.
