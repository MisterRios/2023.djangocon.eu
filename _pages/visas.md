## Do I need a visa to enter the USA?

That depends on what country issued your passport; see the [US State Department](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/tourism-visit.html) website for more information.

## I need a letter to obtain a visa. Can you help me with that?

We sure can! Head over to <a href="/invitation">Get Invitation Letter</a> to request your letter of invitation for your visa application at the US Consulate. You will be required to provide:

- Full name (as it appears on your passport)
- Passport number
- Date of birth
- Home address
- Title of talk you're presenting (if any)
- Amount of opportunity grant funds awarded (if any)

Do this as soon as you can! Wait times to get a visitor visa interview are extremely long (and in some countries are over a year).

## I can't get an appointment with the US Consulate in time for the conference. Can I get a refund?

Send an <a href="mailto:{{site.visa_email}}">email</a> to our visa team and we'll make sure you get taken care of.
