## Do I need a visa to enter the USA?

That depends on what country issued your passport; see the [US State Department](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/tourism-visit.html) website for more information.

## I need a letter to obtain a visa. Can you help me with that?

We sure can! Head over to <a href="/invitation">Get Invitation Letter</a> to self generate your letter of invitation for your visa application at the US Consulate. You will be required to provide the following your name (as it appears on your passport), passport number, date of birth and home address.

Do this as soon as you can! Wait times to get a visitor visa interview are extremely long (and in some countries are over a year).

## I can't get an appointment with the US Consulate in time for the conference. Can I get a refund?

Send an <a href="mailto:{{site.visa_email}}">email</a> to our visa team and we'll make sure you get taken care of.
