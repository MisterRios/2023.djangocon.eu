Announcing our chair for DjangoCon US 2022, [Logan Kilpatrick](https://twitter.com/OfficialLoganK)!

From his [DEFNA bio](https://www.defna.org/about/):
> Logan Kilpatrick is a Senior Technology Advocate at PathAI where he leads Machine Learning and Open Source Advocacy as well as the Developer Community Advocate for the Julia Programming Language. He has also been using and teaching Django at Harvard Universities Division of Continuing Education since early 2020. Outside of work and teaching, Logan is on the Board of Directors at NumFOCUS, the organization behind open source projects like Jupyter, NumPy, Pandas, and more. Open Source and communities are near and dear to Logan so you might run into him giving a talk, tinkering on some new project, or trying to recruit new contributors across the open source ecosystem.

We're proud to bring Logan into the DjangoCon organizing community, and to let the Django community get to know him a little better, we've done a brief Q&A with Logan:

## What brought you into using Django?

## Many of us are less familiar with Julia. Can you tell us a little bit about the community around that language and what you think Django and Python can learn from them or vice versa?

## What inspired you to nominate yourself for the DEFNA Board and then volunteer as conference chair?

## How do you feel teaching Django in an academic context varies from the more "professional" learning tracks (conferences, blog posts, books, YouTube video tutorials, etc.)?

## What sort of hobbies do you enjoy when you're away from the computer?

## What's the best way for people to get in touch with you if they'd like to know more?

Thanks so much for your time, and the entire DEFNA board and DCUS organizer community thanks you for volunteering!
