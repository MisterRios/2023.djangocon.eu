DjangoCon Europe is entirely organised and run by the community.  All of our [organising team](/organisers) are volunteers, and we need your help too!

During the conference days there are many tasks that need to be done, such as helping with venue setup, welcoming and registering attendees, chairing talk sessions.
Volunteering at the conference is a great opportunity to meet other attendees, get 
involved with the community, and see how things happen behind the scenes!

Have a look at the [description of the various tasks](/volunteers/) and [register
your interest](https://forms.gle/xpdbLLrA7ps6Erjy9) in volunteering, and we'll get back to you nearer the time with more
information.

If you have any questions about volunteering or anything else, contact us at
[{{ site.contact_us_email }}](mailto:{{ site.contact_us_email }}).
