I’m Paolo Melchiorre, a longtime *Python* backend developer who contributes to the *Django* project and gives talks at tech *conferences*.

I’ve been a *GNU/Linux* user for over 20 years and I use and promote *Free Software*.

I graduated in Software Engineering and I’m an alumnus of the University of Bologna, Italy.

I’ve been working in the web for 15 years and now I’m the CTO of 20tab, a pythonic software company, for which I work remotely.
