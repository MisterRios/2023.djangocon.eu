I'm currently the CTO of Umuzi - a South African based non-profit organisation focused on launching high-value digital careers for high potential youth in underserved communities.  It's the best job ever, I get to build stuff and change lives. 

I spend my free time climbing, paragliding, reading, and trying to play guitar.
